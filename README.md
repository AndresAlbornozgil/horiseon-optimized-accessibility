# horiseon-optimized-accessibility

## Description
A code refactoring for a marketing agency's website, to make it more accessible for users with disabilities and optimized for search engines. Some individuals, might find difficult to navigate the web due to a disability. With this in mind, I optimized the existing code for Horiseon's website by making sure it meets accessibility standards (optimized semantic of HTML elements, made sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, improved accessibility for alternative (alt) attributes, structured heading attributes in sequential order, and last but not least, made sure that the title element is concise and descriptive). This way, all users have an easier time accessing the content of the website. By refactoring the existing code for the Horiseon's marketing agency website, I learned that it's important to keep every user in mind when building a website, in order to make sure all users are able to access the content with ease.
